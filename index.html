          <p>I'm currently one of 8 entrants competing for up to $800,000 in prizes in the NOAA/ESRL/USBR Sub-Seasonal Forecast Rodeo. Check out the leaderboard to see the current standings and most recent verifications!</p>

          <h2>Sub-seasonal forecasts</h2>
          <p>Forecasts from the Rodeo (weeks 3-4 and weeks 5-6, accumulated precipitation and average temperature) are kept on my site as well, updated every two weeks.
          The official site only maintains the most recent round of verification maps (which you can also find here), so I maintain an archive. </p>

          <p>If I ever feel so inclined as to make a blog post, it'll exist here. It mainly consists of tutorials and how-tos, developed primarily as teaching tools for my undergraduate students (and so that I don't forget what I did and how I set up my computer for scientific research).</p>
